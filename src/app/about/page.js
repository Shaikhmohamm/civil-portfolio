          <p>
            I’m a Civil Engineer with over 6 years of hands-on experience in building construction, 
            specializing in structural execution, shuttering, reinforcement, concreting, and QA/QC supervision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I’ve worked on residential and commercial projects, ensuring 
            quality, safety, and timely completion. My expertise includes coordination with 
            architects, contractors, and clients, as well as on-site management of materials and manpower.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in delivering work that stands for durability, precision, and value — 
            and I’m now preparing to establish my own contracting firm to bring that vision to life.
